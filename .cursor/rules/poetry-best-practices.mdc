- Use `poetry add` to add dependencies and keep `pyproject.toml` up-to-date.
- Regularly run `poetry update` to ensure you have the latest compatible versions.
- Use `poetry lock` to generate a `poetry.lock` file for consistent environments.
- Use `poetry export` to generate requirements files for deployment.
- Keep your `pyproject.toml` organized and use clear dependency groups.
