## 📊 Backend Translation Status

### ✅ Backend i18n is GOOD

**What's Implemented:**

1. **Email Templates** (EN, ES):
   - ✅ Email verification emails
   - ✅ Team invitation emails
   - ✅ Password reset emails

2. **Translation System**:
   - ✅ Multi-language support ready
   - ✅ `language` parameter in all email functions
   - ✅ Professional HTML templates

3. **API Responses**:
   - ✅ English (standard for APIs)
   - ✅ Frontend handles UI translations

**Optional**: Add more email language templates (PT, FR, DE) by:

```python
# In backend/src/invitations/email_templates.py
# Just add 'pt-BR', 'fr-FR', 'de-DE' keys to template dictionaries
```

**But it's not urgent** - Most important is frontend i18n (already done!).

## 🗑️ Documentation Cleanup Recommendation

### Files Safe to Delete (6 duplicates)

rm IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
rm COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
rm FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
rm EMAIL_TEAM_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
rm TEAM_EMAIL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
rm ANSWERS_TO_YOUR_QUESTIONS.md

# Option 2: Archive first (safer)
mkdir _archive
mv IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md _archive/
mv COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md _archive/
mv FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md _archive/
mv EMAIL_TEAM_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md _archive/
mv TEAM_EMAIL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md _archive/
