# Railway Deployment Fix - Implementation Summary

## ðŸš¨ LATEST FIX: Taskipy Command Issue

**Issue**: Railway build failing with "Command not found: task" error during healthcheck.

**Root Cause**: 
- `taskipy` was in dev dependencies but being called during production build
- Circular dependency in `pre_test = 'task lint'` configuration

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Moved taskipy to main dependencies**: Now available during Railway build
2. **Removed circular dependency**: Eliminated `pre_test = 'task lint'` line
3. **Added explicit startup command**: Clear command definition in `railway.toml`
4. **Created nixpacks.toml**: Explicit build instructions for Railway

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `pyproject.toml`
- **Fixed Mako version**: Pinned `mako = "1.3.6"` to avoid the yanked 1.3.7 version
- **Moved taskipy**: From dev dependencies to main dependencies
- **Fixed circular dependency**: Removed `pre_test = 'task lint'` line
- **Added build optimizations**: Added `[tool.poetry.build]` section for better Railway compatibility
- **Kept asyncpg**: Your asyncpg version (0.30.0) is newer and should work better than the problematic 0.29.0

### 2. Updated `railway.toml`
- **Configured Nixpacks builder**: Uses Railway's default Python builder
- **Uses production script**: Leverages your existing `scripts/start-production.sh`
- **Added health check**: Points to your existing `/health` endpoint
- **Set restart policy**: Configured for production resilience

### 3. Created `nixpacks.toml`
- **Explicit build command**: `poetry install --only=main --no-root`
- **Uses production script**: Calls your `scripts/start-production.sh` for startup
- **Environment variables**: PYTHONPATH, SERVER=uvicorn, WORKERS=1

### 4. Created `Dockerfile.railway`
- **Multi-stage build**: Separates build dependencies from runtime
- **Uses production script**: Leverages your existing startup script
- **Optimized for Railway**: Handles compilation issues with asyncpg
- **Security improvements**: Non-root user, minimal runtime dependencies

## Deployment Options

### Option A: Let Railway Auto-detect (Recommended First Try)
1. Push your updated code to GitHub
2. Railway will automatically detect the `railway.toml` and use Nixpacks
3. The fixed Mako version and updated Poetry configuration should resolve the build issues

### Option B: Use Custom Dockerfile
If auto-detection still fails:
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your service settings
2. Under "Build", change from "Nixpacks" to "Dockerfile"
3. Set the Dockerfile path to `Dockerfile.railway`
4. Redeploy

## Environment Variables for Railway

Set these in your Railway dashboard:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Application
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
ENVIRONMENT=production
PYTHONPATH=/app/src

# Optional but recommended
WORKERS=1
PORT=8000
```

## Why This Should Fix Your Issue

1. **Mako Version**: The yanked Mako 1.3.7 was causing warnings and potential build issues
2. **Build Optimization**: Poetry configuration improvements help with Railway's build process
3. **Multi-stage Docker**: If needed, the Railway Dockerfile handles all compilation issues by:
   - Installing build dependencies in builder stage
   - Compiling asyncpg and other native packages
   - Creating clean production image with only runtime dependencies
4. **Asyncpg Compatibility**: Your 0.30.0 version is much newer than the problematic 0.29.0

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: optimize Railway deployment configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Monitor the deployment** in Railway dashboard

3. **If it still fails**, switch to the custom Dockerfile option (Option B above)

## Backup Plan

If you continue having asyncpg issues, you can temporarily switch to psycopg2-binary only:
- Comment out `asyncpg = "^0.30.0"` in pyproject.toml
- Update your database connection string to use `postgresql+psycopg2://` instead of `postgresql+asyncpg://`

Your project already has psycopg2-binary installed, so this would work as an immediate fallback.
