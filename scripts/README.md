# Seed Data System

## 📁 New Structure

The seed data system has been reorganized into a modular structure for better maintainability:

```
scripts/
├── run_seed.py              # Main seed runner script
├── drop_alembic_version.py  # Utility to reset migration history
└── seed/                     # Seed data package
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── constants.py          # Shared constants and utilities
    ├── reset.py              # Database reset functionality
    ├── users.py              # User seed data
    ├── organizations.py      # Organization & membership seed data
    ├── projects.py           # Project seed data
    ├── activity_logs.py      # Activity log seed data
    ├── subscription_plans.py # Subscription plan seed data
    └── subscriptions.py      # Subscription & billing seed data
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Seed Data (Automatic Reset)

The seed script **automatically resets the database** before creating fresh data:

```bash
cd backend
poetry run python scripts/run_seed.py
```

This will:
1. ✅ Drop all existing tables
2. ✅ Recreate all tables from SQLAlchemy models
3. ✅ Populate with fresh seed data

**⚠️ WARNING**: This deletes ALL data! Only use in development.

## 🔧 Modular Structure Benefits

### Easy to Maintain
Each data type is in its own file, making it easy to:
- Find and update specific seed data
- Add new data types
- Modify existing data without affecting others

### Easy to Extend
To add new seed data:
1. Create a new file in `scripts/seed/` (e.g., `teams.py`)
2. Define a creation function
3. Import and call it in `run_seed.py`

Example:
```python
# scripts/seed/teams.py
def create_teams(organizations):
    teams = [
        Team(name="Backend Team", organization_id=organizations[0].id),
        # ...
    ]
    return teams

# In run_seed.py
from seed.teams import create_teams
# ... in run_seed():
teams = create_teams(organizations)
for team in teams:
    session.add(team)
await session.commit()
```

### Reusable Components
- `constants.py`: Shared utilities like `random_ip()` and `random_user_agent()`
- `reset.py`: Database reset logic (reusable across different seed scripts)

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### First Time Setup
```bash
cd backend

# Run seed (automatic reset)
poetry run python scripts/run_seed.py
```

### Daily Development
```bash
# Just run seed - it resets everything automatically
poetry run python scripts/run_seed.py
```

### After Model Changes
```bash
# The seed script uses Base.metadata.create_all()
# So it automatically picks up model changes
poetry run python scripts/run_seed.py
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Automatic Reset
The `run_seed.py` script calls `reset_database()` which:
1. Drops all tables: `Base.metadata.drop_all()`
2. Drops enum types: `DROP TYPE ... CASCADE`
3. Recreates tables: `Base.metadata.create_all()`

### Data Creation Flow
```
1. Subscription Plans (foundation)
2. Users (independent)
3. Organizations (independent)
4. Organization Members (depends on users + orgs)
5. Projects (depends on organizations)
6. Activity Logs (depends on everything)
7. Subscriptions (depends on organizations + plans)
8. Billing History (depends on subscriptions)
9. Payment Activity Logs (depends on billing)
```

## 📝 Customization

### Change Default Password
Edit `scripts/seed/constants.py`:
```python
DEFAULT_PASSWORD = "your_password_here"
```

### Add More Users
Edit `scripts/seed/users.py`:
```python
def create_users():
    users = [
        # ... existing users ...
        User(
            email="newuser@example.com",
            name="New User",
            # ...
        ),
    ]
    return users
```

### Modify Activity Log Diversity
Edit `scripts/seed/constants.py` to add more:
- IP addresses
- User agents
- Any other reusable data

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Development Only
The seed script is designed for **development only**. In production:
- Never run the seed script
- Use proper migrations (Alembic)
- Import real data through APIs or migration scripts

### Confirmation (Optional)
If you want to add a confirmation prompt, modify `run_seed.py`:
```python
async def run_seed():
    print("⚠️  WARNING: This will delete ALL data!")
    confirm = input("Type 'yes' to continue: ")
    if confirm != 'yes':
        print("Cancelled.")
        return
    # ... rest of code
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Table already exists"
The reset should handle this, but if you get this error:
```bash
poetry run python scripts/drop_alembic_version.py
poetry run python scripts/run_seed.py
```

### "Cannot connect to database"
Check your `.env` file has the correct `DATABASE_URL`:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/database
```

### Import Errors
Make sure you're running from the `backend` directory:
```bash
cd backend
poetry run python scripts/run_seed.py
```

## ⚡ Performance Tips

The seed script is optimized for speed:
- ✅ Bulk creates (add all, then single commit)
- ✅ Minimal refreshes (only when IDs needed)
- ✅ Single database connection
- ✅ No unnecessary queries

Typical run time: **2-5 seconds** for all data.
